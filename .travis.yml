# tox-travis makes sure that when tox runs, it only
# runs tox envs that match the travis env we are
# currently running. This allows for tox to test
# against multiple envs when run as
#
#    $ tox
#
# on a developer machine, but ensures that when run from
# travis, it doesn't run every tox env against every version
# of python specified by travis
install:
    - pip install tox-travis

        This method:

        - sets or changes the url, credentials, and certificates on an existing
          object
        - provides a convenient mechanism to validate you can actually connect
          to the server
        - returns a response object that includes information about the server
          you are connected to
        - allows you to inspect the response so you can see why you can't connect

        **Usage**

        >>> url = "http://localhost:808099/manager"
        >>> user = "ace"
        >>> password = "newenglandclamchowder"

        ... except Exception as err:
        ...    # handle exception
        ...    print("not connected")
        not connected

        Many things can go wrong when requesting url's via http. tomcatmanager
        uses the `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library
        for all network communication, and follows that library's approach for
        raising exceptions and checking the response to your request. Therefore:

        - Some exceptions will always be raised by this method. If you give a URL
          where no web server is listening, ``requests.connections.ConnectionError``
          will be raised.
        - Other exceptions will only be raised if you call
          :meth:`.TomcatManagerResponse.raise_for_status()`. For example, if the
          credentials are incorrect, you won't get an exception unless you ask for
          it.
        - The :attr:`.TomcatManagerResponse.ok` attribute is the easiest and most
          rigerous way to check whether you connected successfully. However, as the
          example usage above shows, you still have to catch exceptions because
          `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ can raise
          exceptions from inside the :meth:`.connect` method and this library
          doesn't attempt to catch them so that you can do specific error
          handling if you want to.

        All communications between this library and a Tomcat server happen over HTTP,
        which means there isn't a persistent connection. A new HTTP GET request is
        issued for each method call on this object (i.e. :meth:`~.deploy_localwar`,
        :meth:`~.stop`). However, the mental model for this library is connection
        based: use the :meth:`~.connect` method to establish the URL and authentication
        credentials, then call other methods to perform actions on the server you are
        connected to. If you try and call other methods before you call
        :meth:`~.connect`, :exc:`.TomcatNotConnected` will be raised. Because there
        is no persistent connection of any kind, there is no disconnect method and
        no cleanup to perform when you are done using a server.

        If you discard or don't save the return object from this method, you can call
        :meth:`is_connected` to check if you are connected.

        **Authentication**

        The only way to validate the URL and authentication credentials is to
        make an HTTP request to the server and see if it returns successfully.
        Internally this method tries to retrieve ``/manager/text/serverinfo``.

        Typically authentication is done via user and password. Pass those
        parameters to utilize HTTP Basic authentication.

        To authenticate with a SSL/TLS server using a client certificate and key, pass
        the path to a single file containing the private key and certificate in the
        ``cert`` parameter. As an alternative, you can pass a tuple containing the path
        to the certificate, and the path to the key.

        .. warning::

            The private key for your local certificate must be unencrypted. The
            Requests library used for network communication does not support using
            encrypted keys.

        If the URL uses the ``https`` protocol, the default behavior is to validate
        the server SSL/TLS certificate chain.

        To validate with your own certificate authority bundle, set the
        ``verify`` parameter to the path to a certificate authority bundle file
        or a directory of certificates of trusted certificate authorities. You can
        disable server certificate validation by setting ``verify`` to ``False``.

        See :doc:`/authentication` for more details.

        **Side Effects**

        Passing a ``timeout`` parameter to this method has the side effect of
        setting the :attr:`timeout` attribute on this object.

        Requesting url's via http can also result in redirection to another url. If
        that occurs, the new url, not the one you passed, will be stored in the
        :attr:`url` attribute.

        If you pass user and password credentials and the connection is successful, the
        user will be stored in the :attr:`user` attribute.

        If you pass an authentication key and certificate in the ``cert`` parameter
        and the connection is successful, the information will be stored in the
        :attr:`cert` attribute.

        Upon successful connection, an instance of :class:`.TomcatMajorMinor` will be
        stored in :attr:`tomcat_major_minor` indicating the major version of Tomcat
        running on the server. Further details about the server are available in the
        `server_info` attribute of the returned response.

        The ``leakers`` attribute contains a list of paths of applications
        which leak memory.

        This command triggers a full garbage collection on the server. Use with
        extreme caution on production systems.

        Explicity triggering a full garbage collection from code is documented to be
        unreliable. Furthermore, depending on the jvm, there are options to disable
        explicit GC triggering, like ``-XX:+DisableExplicitGC``. If you want to make
        sure this command triggered a full GC, you will have to verify using something
        like GC logging or JConsole.

        The Tomcat Manager documentation says the server can return duplicates in this
        list if the app has been reloaded and was leaking both before and after the
        reload. The list returned by the ``leakers`` attribute will have no duplicates in
        it.

tomcat-manager
==============

Launching
---------

After installation, you will have a new tool available called
``tomcat-manager``. Run it with no command line arguments to invoke an
interactive, line-oriented command interpreter:

.. code-block:: text

    $ tomcat-manager
    tomcat-manager> connect http://localhost:8080/manager ace newenglandclamchowder
    --connecting... [==  ]
    --connected to http://localhost:8080/manager as ace
    --tomcat version: [Apache Tomcat/10.1.0]
    tomcat-manager> list
    --listing applications... [==  ]
    --Listed applications for virtual host [localhost]
    Path                     Status  Sessions Directory
    ------------------------ ------- -------- ------------------------------------
    /                        running        0 ROOT
    /manager                 running       14 /usr/share/tomcat7-admin/manager
    /host-manager            running        0 /usr/share/tomcat7-admin/host-manager
    tomcat-manager> exit

Use the ``exit`` or ``quit`` command to exit the interpreter and return to your
operating system shell.

.. code-block:: text

    $ tomcat-manager [url] list


Available Commands
------------------

The interactive shell has a built-in list of all available commands:

.. code-block:: text

As well as help for each command. Help for every command is avaialble in two ways:

.. code-block:: text

    tomcat-manager> help connect

Or:

.. code-block:: text

    tomcat-manager> connect -h

Here's some examples:

.. code-block:: text

    tomcat-manager> help stop
    usage: stop [-h] [-v VERSION] path

    Stop a running tomcat application and leave it deployed on the server.

    positional arguments:
        path                  The path part of the URL where the application is
                            deployed.

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                            Optional version string of the application to stop. If
                            the application was deployed with a version string, it
                            must be specified in order to stop the application.

Some commands, like ``deploy``, ``config``, and ``theme`` have multiple
sub-commands.

.. code-block:: text

    tomcat-manager> deploy -h
    usage: deploy [-h] deployment_method ...

    deploy an application to the tomcat server

    positional arguments:
        deployment_method
        local            transmit a war file from the local file system to the server
        server           deploy a war file from the server file system
        context          deploy a context file from the server file system

    options:
        -h, --help         show this help message and exit

    type 'deploy [deployment_method] -h' for more help

Each sub-command also has help:

.. code-block:: text

    tomcat-manager> deploy context -h
    usage: deploy context [-h] [-v VERSION] contextfile [warfile] path

    deploy a context file from the server file system

    positional arguments:
        contextfile           the java-style path (use slashes not backslashes) to the war file on the
                            server file system; don't include 'file:' at the beginning
        warfile               the java-style path (use slashes not backslashes) to the war file on the
                            server file system; don't include 'file:' at the beginning; overrides
                            'docBase' specified in the 'contextfile'
        path                  context path, including the leading slash, on the server where the warfile
                            will be available; overrides the context path in 'contextfile'.

    options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -v, --version VERSION
                            version string to associate with this deployment


This document does not include detailed explanations of every command. It does
show how to connect to a Tomcat server and deploy a war file, since there are
quite a few options for both of those commands. For everything else, the
built-in help should be sufficient.
